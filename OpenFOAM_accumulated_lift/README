This program is used to combine multiple plots for "accumulated_lift_data.txt" obtained from OpenFOAM iterations of the same component.

The "accumulated_lift_data.txt" file can be obtained from "downforce_plot.py" and "downforce_plot_2.py" (OpenFOAM_plot_ParaView repo).

Ensure that all the "accumulated_lift_data.txt" are renamed previously to have a number at the start, like "1_accumulated_lift_data.txt".

Example of the main folder:

1_accumulated_lift_data.txt   --> 1st iteration
2_accumulated_lift_data.txt   --> 2nd iteration
3_accumulated_lift_data.txt   --> 3rd iteration
4_accumulated_lift_data.txt   --> 4th iteration
...                           --> and so on
accumulated_lift.py           --> main program
