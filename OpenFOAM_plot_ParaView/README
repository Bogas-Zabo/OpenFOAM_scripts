Scripts that communicate with ParaView and execute commands to plot the downforce distribution.
Change "foam_reader.MeshRegions" to select the important components from your case "group/", and edit "calc.Function" to change the formula for the computed force.

The program also compares the integrated curve value to the actual integrated force along the model surface (computes the error).

After execution the program also saves two files, "accumulated_lift_data.txt" and "distribution_lift_data.txt" for future post-processing. 

"downforce_plot.py" is to plot distribution and accumulation forces along the component's length, and "downforce_plot_2.py" is to plot along it's width (with symmetry plane).

Put the python scripts in the same folder as the main OpenFOAM case, and run (in this case for ParaView version 5.13.1):

In Ubuntu:

/mnt/c/<path_to_your_ParaView>/ParaView\ 5.13.1/bin/pvpython.exe downforce_plot.py
or 
/mnt/c/<path_to_your_ParaView>/ParaView\ 5.13.1/bin/pvpython.exe downforce_plot_2.py

In CMD:

& "C:\<path_to_your_ParaView>\ParaView 5.13.1\bin\pvpython.exe" downforce_plot.py 
or 
& "C:\<path_to_your_ParaView>\ParaView 5.13.1\bin\pvpython.exe" downforce_plot_2.py
