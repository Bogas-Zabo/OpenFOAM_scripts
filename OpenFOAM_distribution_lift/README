This program is used to combine multiple plots for "distribution_lift_data.txt" obtained from OpenFOAM iterations of the same component.

The "distribution_lift_data.txt" file can be obtained from "downforce_plot.py" and "downforce_plot_2.py" (OpenFOAM_plot_ParaView repo).

Ensure that all the "distribution_lift_data.txt" are renamed previously to have a number at the start, like "1_distribution_lift_data.txt".

Example of the main folder:

1_distribution_lift_data.txt   --> 1st iteration
2_distribution_lift_data.txt   --> 2nd iteration
3_distribution_lift_data.txt   --> 3rd iteration
4_distribution_lift_data.txt   --> 4th iteration
...                            --> and so on
distribution_lift.py           --> main program
